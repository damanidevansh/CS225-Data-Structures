This week our goal was to perform the data correction and data storage steps. Unfortunately, we could not accomplish this task because of an error in our proposal which required us to revise parts of it. This week, we wokred to replace our old algorithm (Floyd Warshall) with a new algorithm, A\^* . The problem we encountered that we did not expect to encounter was that we had to revise our proposal. Next week, we plan to do finish the data correction and data storage, and also begin the implementation of the Breadth-First Search Traversal.

This week we unfortunately had to make another revision to our proposal. We replaced our previously new algorithm A* with another algorithm called the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Our goal was to get started on the data correction and data storage steps however we first wanted to receive feedback on our proposal in order to move on. Now that we recieved feedback and no more corrections to the proposal are need we will begin to work on the data correction and data storage steps along with the implementation of the Breadth-First Search Traversal.

This week our goal is to do the data correction and data storage. We successfully imported the data and succesfully created a new csv file (airports.csv) with only the airport name, airport country, airport coordinates( longitude and latitude), and IATA code. We also did the same thing with the routes dataset. If either one of the IAIA does not match a node(airport) in our graph we would not include this edge in the graph structure. Furthermore, we began to work on the data storage part of the project. This includes populating a graph structure with airports and routes. This upcoming week we will want to finish the data storage portion of the project with test cases and finish one algorithm for the mid project checkin.

This week we implemented the graph structure as well as created exhaustive test cases that verfiy the correctness of our graph structure. We will now begin to implement our algorithms as well as test cases when necessary.
