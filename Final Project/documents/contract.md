# **Team Contract**

## **Communication**

1. **Team Meetings**: Our group will be meeting once a week on Friday at 1:00PM - 3:00PM in person. We will take turns taking notes on a shared google doc and writing the development log.

2. **Assistance**: Our group will be communicating through our discord chat. In addition, we will also reach out to our project mentor if needed. 

3. **Respect**: Everyone will be excellent to each other. Any objections, suggestions, or questions from group members will be listened to and discussed. If someone is stuck understanding something we will be patient and help them understand. No single group member will be making all the decisions for the group.

## **Collaboration**

1. **Work Distribution**: Everyone will participate in the group project and we will distribute work for each team member weekly and evenly. No single group member will "carry" the group and we will work to make sure everyone has a significant role. We will also distribute the amount of functions to be written evenly to each group member. 

2. **Time Commitment**: Every group member will prioritize at least 2 hours a week for the assignment. If one week a member has a new conflict or new time commitment, the rest of the group will work together to spend more time on the project until the next week. We also will be meeting once a week as a group to collaborate and assist any group member that needs help. 

3. **Conflict Resolution**: If there a conflict, we will make sure to communicate the problem to every group member and meet to discuss how to solve it. In the event someone is not putting in the required time or is late to meetings, we will be sure to update the contract 
in order to better fit the needs of the group.
