### Comments

The revised proposal looks good for the most part, but unfortunately you will once again need to change one of your algorithms. This is because we are not allowing groups to implement both Dijkstra's and A* search together due to the fact that they are functionally almost identical. As such, you will either need to change Dijkstra's algorithm (to Bellman-Ford, for example) or implement a different uncovered algorithm. Note that if you choose to stick with A* search, you will need to also define what your heuristic function will be in the proposal as well.

Since this issue is not a clearly stated policy in the project webpage and documents, I will not penalize your group further for another resubmission. As a suggestion for a different uncovered algorithm, many groups either choose a form of centrality (such as betweenness centrality) or they project their graph/routes onto a world map for this dataset.
