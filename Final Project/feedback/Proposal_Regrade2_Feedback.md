### Comments

Your revised proposal with Bellman-Ford looks great, and I am approving this project topic. Since I don't believe your dataset and edge weighting formulation would result in negative edge weight cycles, I recommend that you try constructing your own graphs with these negative cycles to fully test your Bellman-Ford implementation. 

Good luck working on your project, and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
