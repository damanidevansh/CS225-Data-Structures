I liked how your presentation was clear and covered all the necessary components thoroughly, while also going through the code in detail. However, the presentation was missing the concluding thoughts of each member. Additionally, the speaking time did seem somewhat skewed towards one member doing a lot of the talking, so perhaps this could have been divided better.

In terms of your writeup, I think you have done a great job of explaining your algorithms and how you have proven their correctness. That said, I would have liked to see more actual outputs of your algorithms on the full dataset, to show an example output for certain cases.

Your implemented algorithms appear to be correct and are successfully able to run on a large scale sample. Regarding your tests, you have a good amount of test cases but I would have liked to see more test cases for each individual algorithm, as well as edge cases for these algorithms. For example, I think a Bellman-Ford test case on a graph with negative edge weights would have been useful to verify correctness. In terms of code execution, there is unfortunately no way to specify an input or output file easily without manually editing the code, and the same goes for selecting an algorithm to run. Other than that, I think your group has done a great job on the project overall!
