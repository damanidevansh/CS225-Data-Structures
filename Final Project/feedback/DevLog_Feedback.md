# Development Log Feedback


## Week of 3/28 - 4/3


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
Your group spent time working on refining the proposal, which looks good aside from the issue of Dijkstra's and A* search conflicting. I gave some suggestions for other uncovered algorithms you may want to implement in the revised proposal feedback. Let me know if you have any questions while drafting your final proposal.


## Week of 4/4 - 4/10


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
As I mentioned, the new proposal looks good. In preparation for the mid-project check-in meeting, don't forget to include test cases for one of your algorithms (likely BFS) and your graph data structure. Good progress thus far.

## Week of 4/11 - 4/17


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
Definitely try to get your graph data structure functional and with thorough testing, as it is clearly a key component for the project. Do note that if you cannot fully implement an algorithm before the check-in meeting, it is also fine if you have completed your data parsing (with correction) pipeline thoroughly. Other than that, I think your progress is on track.


## Week of 4/18 - 4/24


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
I would say your group is still somewhat behind in terms of progress but the project as a whole is still quite doable given the remaining time.
